# This is the number of beats to wait before starting to play the melody again.

number_of_bars_before_starting_the_next_voice = 1

# This is how many times you want the melody to play (how many parts/voices in the canon).
number_of_voices = 3

# This is the type of sound you want to use for each voice. See Buffer 3 for the options.
# **Make sure you type it correctly or it will be silent!**
sounds = [:pulse, :prophet, :dpulse]

# This is the transpose you want to apply to each voice, in octaves. To have them all the same, just
# write zero in each. To put it up an octave use 1, down an octave use -1, up two octaves use 2 etc.
transpose = [-1, 0, 1]

# This is the tempo (speed) of the piece, in beats per minute.

# This is your canon. The whole piece goes inside square brackets ([]) and each note goes inside
# curly brackets ({}). Each note needs a pitch and a length and separate each note with a
# comma. e.g. [{pitch: :c, length: 1}, {pitch: :d, length: 0.5}]
