Today we will be starting on a Ruby application that performs various NLP related tasks.
The application name will be called "RobotStuff"

A high-level overview of the features:

Sentiment analysis: Transforms large amounts of customer feedback, reviews, or social media reactions into actionable results.
Machine translation: Translates large amounts of text from a target to a source language.
Named-entity recognition: Extracts entities from text, such as people, locations, organizations, and dates.
Automatic summarization: Creates summaries and synopses for indexes, research databases, or busy readers.
Topic model: Identifies a text's topic using unsupervised machine learning.
Parsing: Verifies the correct syntax of a group of words and creates a structural input representation.
Document classification: Assigns tags to texts to put them in categories.
Stemming: Reduces words to their word stem.
Lemmatization: Reduces words to their root word.
Visual Mapping: Produce graphs of phrases and sentences to show correlations

A table of gems that will be used in this application:

Use the Pipes-and-Filters design pattern. Pipes-and-Filters describes how
systems process data streams.

In this pattern, data enters the system from multiple sources and passes through sequential filters that transform the data from one format to another.

For the Segmenting, use pragmatic_tokenizer, using the [golden_rules](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tm-town-nlp-resources/golden_rules.txt)

Let's think through this step by step.
